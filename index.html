    <p class="binuintro">Binu, originally from Sri Lanka, is a passionate handyman who loves construction and fixing things around the houseâ€”just like Bob the Builder. Outside of his projects, he enjoys playing cricket every Sunday, despite currently being on a losing streak. A fan of Forrest Gump and Vikings, he values learning, self-improvement, and taking on new challenges. His design preferences lean towards a minimalist aesthetic, inspired by Google, with a color palette influenced by the Sri Lanka cricket team, incorporating both pastel and dark shades. Currently, Binu is working on an app itinerary, combining his love for structure, creativity, and continuous growth.</p>
